Hi and welcome to my Github!

I am Kaisar Imtiyaz. You can call me a Deep Learning practicioner. I like working on problems involving data whether big or small. Through out my journey in this field I worked on problems spanning domains like Classical and Statistical ML, Generative AI(LLMs, RAG etc). I have worked on various projects which you can find under my repository section. You can also find code implementations of solutions to problems I find intersting or papers I read or sometimes algorithms that intruige me in the same section.

You can reach me via [Email](mailto:ikaisar10@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaisar-imtiyaz/).
